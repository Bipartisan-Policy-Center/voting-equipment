    "## Replicate the findings in Brennan's [Costs for Replacing Voting Equipment in 2024](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/costs-replacing-voting-equipment-2024)\n",
    "### Footnote 3\n",
    "To reach this estimate, we relied on Verified Voting data from January 2024. This estimate assumes that precinct count optical scan machines cost \\\\$5,000 each and ballot-marking devices cost \\\\$3,500 each. We multiplied each of these costs by 4,407, the number of precincts that still use direct recording electronic voting machines without a voter-verified paper audit trail for all voters on Election Day. This amounts to \\\\$37,459,500.
